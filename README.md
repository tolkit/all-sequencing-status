This repo documents the status of each species with data in the Darwin Tree of Life Project, grouped by order of Eukaryote.

The `clades` folder contains the orders of Eukaryotes for which at least one species has some data attached. A maximum of two tables are then presented, one for assemblies (either draft, curated, or released/public) and one for genomic data (Hi-C, PacBio or 10X).
